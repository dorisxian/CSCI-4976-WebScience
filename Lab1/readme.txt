Some notes and observation:

I tried to add user profile image but most of the pictures canot be shown and got the error: 'Failed to load resource'.

I spent a huge amount of time to figure out how to achieve the timer (3s) effect one by one. I have tried using for loop and jquery .each together with .delay(), setTimeout() functions and finally end up with correctly using setInterval() without a loop to do so.

Also, I accidentally found out that Chrome cannot load local files using getJSON and this is actually a known issue with Chrome for web security reason. I am glad my default browser is Safari so I started testing from there.

This is a real reviewing assignment for me! It is much more time consuming than I thought. The reason probably because it has been one year after I took the websys 1. Time flies but I feel good when I get everything worked like I want them for. =)
